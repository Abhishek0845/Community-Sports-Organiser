Here's a complete plan for your AI chatbot project: **Community Sports Tournament Organizer**. This will include all necessary **features**, how it should **function**, and how it should **look**.

---

## 🎯 **Project Goal**
Create an AI chatbot that helps users **organize**, **manage**, and **inquire** about community sports tournaments. It will only respond to queries strictly related to community sports events.

---

## ✅ **Core Features**

### 1. **User Interaction**
- Register team/player for a tournament
- Ask for tournament schedule
- Ask about venue and timings
- Check eligibility criteria for participation
- Ask about rules of specific sports
- Get updates on ongoing tournaments
- Contact event organizers (name, email, phone)

---

### 2. **Organizer Interaction**
- Add/edit tournament details (dates, teams, matches)
- Set rules per sport
- Update score and standings
- Announce winners

---

### 3. **Sports Covered**
- Cricket
- Football
- Volleyball
- Badminton
- Kabaddi (can vary based on locality)

---

### 4. **Chatbot Constraints**
- It **must not answer** off-topic queries
- Replies with “I can only help with community sports tournament-related queries” for anything irrelevant
- Should be able to handle **FAQs** like:
  - "When does the football tournament start?"
  - "Can I register my team online?"
  - "What’s the prize for the cricket finals?"

---

## 💡 **Technical Stack (Suggested)**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, React, or HTML + CSS
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Database**: SQLite or Firebase (for team/player/tournament info)
- **Chatbot Engine**: 
  - Rule-based chatbot using `Rasa` or `ChatterBot`
  - Or LLMs with strict **intent filters** (via Langchain or transformers + custom rules)
- **Deployment**: Localhost or Streamlit Share/Render/Heroku

---

## 💬 **Chatbot UI Design**
- **Left Pane**: Chat window
- **Right Pane** (optional):
  - Upcoming matches
  - Register/Login buttons
  - Announcements section
- **Style**: Clean, sporty theme with team logos, vibrant buttons, and responsive design

---

## 🔁 **Sample User Flow**

### 1. User: “I want to register my football team”
> Chatbot: “Great! Please provide your team name, captain’s name, and contact number.”

### 2. User: “When is the next volleyball match?”
> Chatbot: “The next volleyball match is scheduled for April 21st at 4:30 PM at XYZ Ground.”

### 3. User: “Who won the last cricket match?”
> Chatbot: “Team Thunder won the last match with 6 wickets against Team Blaze.”

---

## 🛑 **Handling Off-topic Queries**
- User: “What’s the weather today?”
> Chatbot: “Sorry, I can only assist with community sports tournament-related questions.”

---
